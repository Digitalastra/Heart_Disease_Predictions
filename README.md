# Heart_Disease_Predictions


Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains patient data, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical indicators. By analyzing these features, the model can help identify patients at risk of heart disease, providing a valuable tool for early intervention and treatment.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of data distribution, correlation analysis, and key insights.
Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and more.
Evaluation: Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model parameters to improve performance.
Deployment: An example of deploying the model using a web interface or an API for practical use.
